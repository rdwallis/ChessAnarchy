A couple of weeks ago, a few thousand people began playing a game of
Pok&#233;mon. By sending a message to a chat window any of them could
press a button on a virtual Game Boy. The result was a barely
organized chaos that managed to beat the game over 16 sleepless days.

I built Chess Anarchy to find out what happens when you play
chess in the same way. 

You can make a move by dragging a piece across the board or by
typing the move into the chat window. Your move is a vote that
influences the move that will be made by your team. The way your vote
is counted is determined by your team's system of government, which
is chosen at the beginning of the game. 

###The Systems of Government are:
####Anarchy
Under anarchy the first legal move received by the server is
immediately played. 

####Democracy
Under democracy votes are counted after 9 seconds and the most
popular move is played. If you vote more than once only your last
vote counts. 

####Hipsterism
Hipsters liked your move before it became popular.
Under Hipsterism the votes are counted after 9 seconds and then the
least popular move is made. If you vote more than once only your last
vote counts.
